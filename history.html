            <h2 style="color: red;">Indus Valley Civilization (3300-1300 BCE)</h2>
            <p style="width: 500px;font-style: italic; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.667); padding:5px ;border-radius: 12px;">
                The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished from about 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE in areas of present-day Pakistan and northwest India. Centered on advanced cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, it featured remarkable urban planning, drainage systems, and standardized bricks. The people cultivated wheat, barley, and cotton, domesticated animals, and traded with distant regions. They used undeciphered script and seals for trade. The civilization declined around 1900 BCE, likely due to climate changes and shifting rivers, leaving a legacy as one of the world’s earliest urban cultures.</p>

                The Maurya Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE, became the first to unify most of India. With guidance from the strategist Chanakya, Chandragupta built a vast, highly organized administration from his capital at Pataliputra. His son Bindusara expanded the realm further. Ashoka, the greatest Mauryan ruler, extended the empire to its peak and, after the bloody Kalinga War, embraced Buddhism, spreading its principles far and wide. The empire was known for its strong bureaucracy, centralized control, and infrastructure. After Ashoka’s death, the empire weakened and eventually ended in 185 BCE.</p>

                The Mughal Empire (1526–1857) was a major Islamic dynasty that ruled most of the Indian subcontinent for over three centuries. Founded by Babur after his victory over Ibrahim Lodi in the First Battle of Panipat (1526), the empire expanded under notable rulers like Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. Akbar (1556–1605) consolidated Mughal power, promoted religious tolerance, and established a centralized administration. The empire reached its zenith under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, before decentralizing and weakening due to internal conflict and regional uprisings. British colonial rule began to overshadow the Mughals, culminating in the empire’s formal end after the Revolt of 1857.</p>

            <h2 style="color: red;">British Raj (1858-1947)</h2>
            <p style="width: 500px;font-style: italic; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.667); padding:5px ;border-radius: 12px;">
                The British Raj (1858–1947) refers to the period of direct British Crown rule over the Indian subcontinent following the transfer of power from the East India Company after the 1857 Rebellion. This era saw large-scale political and administrative changes: the British established centralized governance, promoted Western education and legal systems, built railways and telegraphs, and structured the Indian Army. However, economic policies and exploitation led to famines and widespread poverty among Indians. The Raj comprised both directly administered British provinces and indirectly controlled princely states. Growing Indian dissatisfaction with colonial rule spurred a powerful independence movement, leading to the end of the Raj with the partition of British India into two nations, India and Pakistan, on August 15, 1947.</p>

            <h2 style="color: red;">Modern India(1947-present)</h2>
            <p style="width: 500px;font-style: italic; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.667); padding:5px ;border-radius: 12px;">
                Modern India since independence in 1947 has evolved from a newly sovereign state into a major global player. Following partition and the trauma of mass migration and violence, India adopted a democratic constitution in 1950. Early leaders like Nehru focused on industrialization, social reforms, and state reorganization. Conflicts with Pakistan and China shaped defense and foreign policy, while economic policy transitioned from socialism to liberalization in 1991, unleashing rapid growth. India sustained its democratic system, witnessed key technological and nuclear advances, and faced ongoing social challenges such as inequality, insurgencies, and regional conflicts.</p>
